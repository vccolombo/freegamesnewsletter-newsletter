# Free Games Newsletter newsletter

This is the repository for the [Free Games Newsletter](https://www.freegamesnewsletter.com/) newsletter. It is actually mostly the Steam crawler, but also the mail generator for the newsletter.

## What is the Newsletter

**Free Games Newsletter** sends you an email when a game is free-to-keep for a limited time on Steam.

I had this idea after being frustrated about losing many free games because Steam doesn't publish on its front page when a game is free-to-keep.
